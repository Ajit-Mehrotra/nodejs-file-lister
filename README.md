# Terminal File Lister
Works the same way as `ls` except it colors folders in cyan. Works for all local directories. Colors can be changed.

Runs with the `nls` command. For node-list...since I used nodejs to make this. 

After cloning, you will have to be in the current directory of the index.js file and you will have to type `npm link` in the terminal. This will grant you access to using the `nls` command. Use `npm unlink` to unlink this command and remove it from your machine. 

This was a practice project. Nothing more. Nothing less.
